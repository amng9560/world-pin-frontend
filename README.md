## General info
World Pin is a simple web appplication that allows the users to make current, 1 year, 5 year and 10 year plans. They can do this by logging in, going to the country tab, browsing the countries, then using the drag and drop feature and selecting the countries they'd like to visit. In that section there is a drop menu to select if is a current, 1 year, 5 year or 10 year plan. Then when finishing creating a plan, they can view all plans with the associated countries in their profile.
